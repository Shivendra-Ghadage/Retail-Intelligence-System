# 🏬 Retail Business Intelligence & Predictive Analytics System
End-to-End Data Analytics Project using Python, SQL & Power BI


## About the Project

This project is an end-to-end Retail Business Intelligence and Predictive Analytics system developed using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The main goal of this project is to analyze large retail sales data (200,000+ records) and extract meaningful insights to help businesses make better decisions.

In this project, I worked on the complete data analytics lifecycle — from data cleaning to machine learning and dashboard development.


## Project Objectives

* Analyze retail sales performance
* Predict future sales using time-series forecasting
* Identify customers who are likely to churn
* Analyze Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
* Evaluate marketing channel performance
* Study return rate and operational efficiency

##  Dataset Details

* Dataset Size: 200,000+ records
* Time Period: 2021–2024
* Includes transaction, customer, marketing, and logistics data

### Important Features in Dataset:

* Sales
* Profit
* Discount
* Customer_Lifetime_Value
* Churn (0 = Active, 1 = Churned)
* Marketing_Channel
* Payment_Mode
* Delivery_Days
* Returned
* Customer_Tenure_Months

## Technologies Used

###  Programming Language

* Python

### Python Libraries

* Pandas (Data manipulation)
* NumPy (Numerical operations)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
* Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
* XGBoost (Advanced ML model)
* Statsmodels (ARIMA Forecasting)

###  Database

* SQL (Data extraction and business queries)

### BI Tool

* Power BI
* DAX (KPI calculations)


##  Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Loaded dataset using Pandas
* Checked and handled missing values
* Removed duplicates
* Converted date columns
* Created new useful features


### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering

* Extracted Year, Month, Quarter
* Calculated Profit Margin
* Created Age Groups
* Performed RFM segmentation
* Used CLV and Churn columns for modeling


### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Monthly sales trend analysis
* Category-wise and region-wise performance
* Discount impact on profit
* Churn distribution
* Return rate analysis


### 4️⃣ SQL Business Analysis

* Top customers identification
* Revenue contribution percentage
* Region-wise profit analysis
* Ranking using window functions


### 5️⃣ Machine Learning – Churn Prediction

* Used Random Forest and XGBoost
* Performed train-test split
* Evaluated using Accuracy and ROC-AUC


### 6️⃣ Time-Series Forecasting

* Created daily sales series
* Applied ARIMA model
* Forecasted next 30 days sales


### 7️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Created interactive dashboards including:

* Executive Overview Dashboard
* Customer Analytics Dashboard
* Marketing Performance Dashboard

KPIs Created Using DAX:

* Total Sales
* Total Profit
* Profit Margin
* Churn Rate
* Return Rate
* Monthly Growth %


## 📊 Key Insights

* Technology category generated highest profit
* Higher discounts reduced profit margin
* Tier 1 customers had highest CLV
* Email marketing showed lower churn rate
* Faster delivery reduced return rate
